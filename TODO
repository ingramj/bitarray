* Comment code. I'd like for it to be useful as a tutorial for extension
  writing, especially with regards to implementing new types.
* Fix cloning, and allow slices.
* Implement some more methods, like Hamming weight, and in-place enumerator
  methods (map!, reverse!, etc).
* Maybe allow resizing.
* Write more tests
* Ruby 1.8 compatibility. This will probably involve just changing some of the
  NUM2x and x2NUM defines.
