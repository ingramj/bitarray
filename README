A bit array class for Ruby, implemented as a C extension. Includes methods for
setting and clearing individual bits, and all bits at once. Also has the
standard array access methods, [] and []=, and it mixes in Enumerable.

The test/ directory has a unit test file. It also has a benchmark utility for
comparison with Peter Cooper's pure Ruby BitField class.

This extension has only been tested with Ruby 1.9.1 on Ubuntu, and probably
won't compile for Ruby 1.8. Compatibility with Ruby 1.8 is planned.

This library is available as a gem. Install it with

sudo gem install ingramj-bitarray -s http://gems.github.com

Alternately, you can clone the repository and build things manually.

See the TODO file for current limitations and plans.

See the LICENSE file for copyright and license information.

Some inspiration was taken from Peter Cooper's BitField class, and various Open
Source bitarray implementations found online, but this implementation contains
only original code, except for test/bitfield.rb, which is Peter Cooper's
BitField class, and test/test.rb, which was modified from the BitField test
code.
